1) Of a skip list of n elements, the highest level a node can be, will be log n. It is the largest level that can still maintain a balanced skip list while remaining at a good time efficiency.

2) Each node in an ideal skip list does not have an equal probability of appearing at a specific level. Instead, the probability lies in a logarithmic distribution, where the probablity of encountering a specific node
	decreases by a factor of 2 as the levels increase, so the probability of encountering a node h is, in fact 1/2^h-1. (Example, the probablity of finding node h in level 2 in a list is 1/2). This is not exact as the method
	that determines if a node increases in level upon insertion is random, but the randomization has a probability of 50% so we can be approximately confident that this calculation will hold as the list increases in size.
	
3)	- Begin with pointer at the top left (level 4).
	- Pointer follows from beggining to end, end is > 50.
	- Pointer moves down from beggining level 4 to beginning level 3.
	- Pointer follows from beginning to 19, 19 is < 50.
	- Pointer follows from 19 to 32, 32 is < 50.
	- Pointer follows from 32 to 71, 71 is > 50.
	- Pointer moves down from 32 level 3 to 32 level 2.
	- Pointer follows from 32 to 33, 33 is < 50.
	- Pointer follows from 33 to 54, 54 is > 50.
	- Pointer moves down from 33 level 3 to 33 level 2.
	- Pointer follows from 33 to 36, 36 < 50.
	- Pointer follows from 36 to 40, 40 < 50.
	- Pointer follows from 40 to 50, 50 = 50, Pointer at destination.

In order to test my step by step calculation of ranks as the program runs, respond with "yes" to the console prompt, this will enable printouts
of the right and left pointer ranks for each node affected by any particular insertion or deletion. As well as a printout of the Skip List at each insertion and deletion for
easy following.

I didn't realize we had to unzip the .jar file to access the files within, so I implemented the SkipList from a tutorial I found online at :

http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/323/Syllabus/Map/skip-list-impl.html#newlayer

I still completed the assignment fully, but I had an extra class to accommodate the printouts, as the tutorial allowed both vertical and horizontal and I liked the ease of use.

Due to the lack of SkipListTest.java, I implemented all my tests directly into the main class of SkipList.java.

I have used randomized values for the inputs as well as the choice of ranks, so duplicating tests might be difficult, but as I feel my implementation is correct, this gives the
best range of tests as it covers all possibilities. You can change the values of these inputs in the main method of the SkipList class.
